[Round 1] Direct answer
============================================================

[User] <image> + answer prompt

[Assistant]
The white sign is mounted on a pole near the front of the bus, which is the closest object to the camera in the image. The trash bin is further back on the sidewalk, behind the bus. Therefore, the white sign is closer to the camera.

Answer: B

[Round 2] Depth-assisted answer
============================================================

[User] <depth_map> + depth prompt

[Assistant]
1. The trash bin is located on the far left of the image, in the background, and appears as a dark region in the depth map. The white sign is located to the left of the bus, also in the background, and appears as a medium-to-dark region in the depth map. The bus itself is the brightest object, but it is not one of the options. 
2. Comparing the two options, the trash bin is darker than the white sign, indicating it is farther from the camera. The white sign is medium-to-dark, meaning it is closer than the trash bin but still farther than the bus. 
3. Based on the depth map, the white sign is closer to the camera than the trash bin.

Answer: B
