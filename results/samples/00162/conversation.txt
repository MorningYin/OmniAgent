[User] <depth_map> + depth prompt

[Assistant]
1. The airplane is visible as a dark silhouette in the upper portion of the image, with its wings extending across the frame. The airport lounge is not clearly identifiable as a distinct object in this depth map; the background is very dark and indistinct. However, the airplane's silhouette is darker than the silhouettes of the people in the foreground, indicating it is farther away.  
2. The airplane is darker (further away) than the people in the foreground, but the airport lounge is not clearly visible or distinguishable in the depth map to compare directly.  
3. Based on the available visual information, the airplane appears to be the most distant object in the scene.
