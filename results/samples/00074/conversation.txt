[User] <depth_map> + depth prompt

[Assistant]
1. The blue motorcycle is located in the upper-middle portion of the image, behind the foreground bicycle. In the depth map, its region appears medium-dark, indicating it is farther than the foreground bicycle but not as far as the green motorcycle. The green motorcycle is located in the upper-left background, behind the blue motorcycle. Its region is noticeably darker than the blue motorcycle’s region, indicating it is farther from the camera.

2. Comparing the two, the green motorcycle’s darker region confirms it is farther away than the blue motorcycle.
