[User] <depth_map> + depth prompt

[Assistant]
1. The tennis racket is located near the bottom center of the image, resting on the ground in front of the seated person. In the depth map, its region is bright, indicating it is close to the camera. The little boy is visible in the background, behind the main subject, and his region in the depth map is darker than the foreground objects, indicating he is farther away.  
2. Comparing the two, the little boy’s region is darker than the tennis racket’s region, meaning the little boy is further away from the camera.
