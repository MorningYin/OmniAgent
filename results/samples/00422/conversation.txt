The baseball bat is held by the batter who is standing further back in the scene compared to the catcher holding the baseball glove, which is positioned closer to home plate and thus closer to the camera. Therefore, the baseball bat is further away from the camera.

[Assistant]
1. The baseball bat is part of the batter’s silhouette, located in the center-right of the image. Its region is bright white, indicating it is close to the camera. The baseball glove is part of the catcher’s silhouette on the far left. Its region is also bright white, indicating it is also close to the camera. However, the batter’s silhouette (including the bat) is more centrally positioned and appears larger in the frame than the catcher’s silhouette, suggesting the batter is closer to the camera than the catcher. But according to the depth map, both are bright white, meaning they are both close to the camera. The question asks which is further away. Since both are bright, they are not further away from the camera than the darker regions. But the catcher’s glove is on the far left, and the batter’s bat is more central and appears larger, suggesting the batter is closer to the camera. Therefore, the baseball glove is further away from the camera than the baseball bat.
