[Round 1] Direct answer
============================================================

[User] <image> + answer prompt

[Assistant]
The gray bag is on the right side of the image and appears to be hanging on a person who is standing behind the motorcycle, while the gloves are on the handlebars of the motorcycle, which is positioned much closer to the camera. Therefore, the gloves are closer to the camera.

Answer: A

[Round 2] Depth-assisted answer
============================================================

[User] <depth_map> + depth prompt

[Assistant]
1. The gloves are located on the handlebars of the motorcycle, which is the most prominent object in the foreground. In the depth map, this region is very bright, indicating it is very close to the camera. The gray bag is on the right side of the image, on a person standing behind the motorcycle. This region is much darker in the depth map, indicating it is farther from the camera.

2. Comparing the brightness, the gloves (on the motorcycle) are significantly brighter than the gray bag, meaning the gloves are closer to the camera.
