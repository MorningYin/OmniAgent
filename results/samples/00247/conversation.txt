[Round 1] Direct answer
============================================================

[User] <image> + answer prompt

[Assistant]
The man in the grey suit is in the background, behind the cake stand, while the man in the striped shirt is further back, near the white fence. The cake and its immediate surroundings are closest to the camera, so neither of these men is near the camera. However, since the question asks which of the two is closer, the man in the grey suit is slightly closer than the man in the striped shirt. 

Answer: A

[Round 2] Depth-assisted answer
============================================================

[User] <depth_map> + depth prompt

[Assistant]
1. The man in the grey suit is not visible as a distinct object in the depth map; the bright central object is the cake. The man in the striped shirt is also not visible as a distinct object in the depth map; the background is dark and indistinct. The depth map only shows the cake as the brightest object, with the background being dark. 

2. Since neither of the specified people can be located in the depth map, we cannot compare their relative depth based on the provided map. However, based on the original image, the man in the grey suit is closer than the man in the striped shirt. The depth map does not provide enough information to contradict this.
