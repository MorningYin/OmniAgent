[User] <depth_map> + depth prompt

[Assistant]
1. The "Broadway" sign is visible as a bright white region in the depth map, indicating it is close to the camera. The "board that says 'The Event'" is also visible as a bright white region, but it appears slightly darker and less intense than the "Broadway" sign, suggesting it is slightly farther away.

2. Comparing the two, the "Broadway" sign is brighter (closer), while "The Event" board is slightly darker (farther).
