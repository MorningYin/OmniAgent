The blue double-decker bus is in the foreground, and the sign with a person on it is on a building to the right, which is further back. The yellow bus on the left is also further back, behind the blue bus. The sign with the person is closer than the yellow bus but still behind the blue bus. However, the question asks which is closer to the camera, and the blue bus is the closest object overall. But since the options are only the yellow bus and the sign, and the sign is on the building which is closer than the yellow bus (which is further down the road), the sign is closer to the camera than the yellow bus.
