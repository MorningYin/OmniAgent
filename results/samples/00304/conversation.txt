The milk is located on the right side of the refrigerator door, which is closer to the camera than the container in the fridge, which is inside the main compartment. Therefore, the container in the fridge is further away from the camera.

Answer: B

[Round 2] Depth-assisted answer

[User] <depth_map> + depth prompt

[Assistant]
1. The milk is located on the right door shelf, appearing as a bright (whiter) region in the depth map, indicating it is close to the camera. The container in the fridge is located inside the main compartment, appearing as a medium-dark region in the depth map, indicating it is farther from the camera. 
2. Since the container in the fridge is darker (farther) than the milk (brighter, closer), the container in the fridge is further away from the camera.

Answer: B
