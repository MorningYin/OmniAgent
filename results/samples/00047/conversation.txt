[Assistant]
The "one way" sign is mounted below the stop sign and street signs on the same pole, but it is positioned lower and slightly behind them from the camera’s perspective, making it appear further away. The street signs are at the top of the pole, closer to the camera's viewpoint.

[User] <depth_map> + depth prompt

[Assistant]
1. The "one way" sign is the lower rectangular sign with an arrow, located below the stop sign. In the depth map, this region is medium-brightness. The "street signs" (SE 4th and SE 11th Av) are the two blue signs at the top of the pole, and they appear as bright white in the depth map.
2. Since brighter pixels are closer, the street signs are closer to the camera than the one way sign.
3. Therefore, the one way sign is further away from the camera.
