[Round 2] Depth-assisted answer
============================================================

[User] <depth_map> + depth prompt

[Assistant]
1. The "yellow store sign on the left" is not visible in the depth map as it is not present in the grayscale image. The bright white object on the left is likely a vehicle or structure, not the sign. The "yellow box sign on the right" is also not visible in the depth map; the dark area on the right is part of the background or a building, not the sign. Since neither object appears in the depth map, we cannot determine their relative depth from it. 

2. As neither object is visible in the depth map, a comparison cannot be made.
