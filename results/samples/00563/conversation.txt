[Assistant]
1. The white parking sign is visible in the depth map as a medium-gray object located on the sidewalk in the background, to the right of the pole. The yellow sign is also visible in the background, further down the street, appearing as a darker gray region compared to the parking sign.
2. Since the yellow sign appears darker in the depth map, it is farther from the camera than the white parking sign.
