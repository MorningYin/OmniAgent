[Assistant]
The street light is positioned in the background, behind the person and the snow-covered trees, making it clearly further away from the camera than the snowboard, which is held by the person in the foreground. 
Answer: B

[Round 2] Depth-assisted answer

[User] <depth_map> + depth prompt

[Assistant]
1. The snowboard is held by the person in the foreground, so its region in the depth map is bright (close to the camera). The street light is located in the background, behind the person and trees, so its region in the depth map is dark (far from the camera). 
2. Since the street light is darker than the snowboard in the depth map, it is further away from the camera. 
Answer: B
