[Round 2] Depth-assisted answer
============================================================

[User] <depth_map> + depth prompt

[Assistant]
1. The fridge is not visible in the depth map as a distinct object; the area where the fridge would be (left side) is mostly dark, suggesting it's far, but the depth map doesn't show it clearly. The oven is visible on the right side of the image, behind the chair, and appears as a darker region compared to the chair and the table in the foreground. 2. Since the oven region is darker than the foreground elements, it is farther away from the camera according to the depth map. The fridge is not clearly identifiable in the depth map, but the oven is clearly farther than the foreground. Answer: B

Final answer: B
  Round 1: B
