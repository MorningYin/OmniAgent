[User] <image> + answer prompt

[Assistant]
The white van is in the foreground, closer to the viewer, while the airplane is in the background, visible through the window. The laptop and the man are even closer to the camera than the van, but among the given options, the van is the closest.

Answer: A

[Round 2] Depth-assisted answer
============================================================

[User] <depth_map> + depth prompt

[Assistant]
1. The white van is not visible in this depth map as it is not part of the scene shown. The airplane is also not visible in this depth map, as the image only shows a person and a laptop. The depth map corresponds to the person and laptop in the foreground, not the background airport scene.  
2. Since neither the white van nor the airplane appears in the depth map, we cannot compare their relative depth using this map.  
3. However, based on the original image, the white van is in the foreground, closer to the camera than the airplane. The depth map does not contradict this, as it only shows the foreground subject.
