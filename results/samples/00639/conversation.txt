The toy car is on the cake, which is on the table in the foreground, while the knife in the hand is being held by the man who is standing further back in the scene. Therefore, the knife in the hand is further away from the camera.

Answer: B

[Round 2] Depth-assisted answer

[User] <depth_map> + depth prompt

[Assistant]
1. The toy car is located on the cake in the foreground, appearing as a bright white region in the depth map. The knife in the hand is held by the man, whose silhouette is also bright white, indicating it is close to the camera.
2. Comparing the two, both are bright, but the toy car is slightly more in the foreground (brighter) than the knife in the hand, which is held by the man standing further back. However, the question asks which is further away. Since the knife in the hand is part of the man’s body, and the man is standing behind the table where the cake is, the knife in the hand is actually further from the camera than the toy car.
3. Therefore, the knife in the hand is further away from the camera.
