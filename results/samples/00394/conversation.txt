1. The laptop is in the center of the image, appearing as a bright, medium-gray region in the depth map, indicating it is relatively close to the camera. The remote control is located on the left side of the image, in a darker region, indicating it is farther from the camera.  
2. Since the remote control is darker (farther) than the laptop (closer), the remote control is further away from the camera.
