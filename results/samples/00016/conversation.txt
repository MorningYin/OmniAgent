[User] <image> + answer prompt

[User] <depth_map> + depth prompt

[Assistant]
1. The TV is not clearly visible as a distinct object in the depth map, but the area where it would be (on the stand near the stairs) appears as a medium-dark region. The stairs, visible on the right side of the image, appear as a darker region compared to the TV area. 
2. The stairs are darker than the TV area, indicating they are farther from the camera. The TV area is brighter (medium-dark) than the stairs, meaning it is closer to the camera.
3. Based on the depth map, the TV is closer to the camera than the stairs.
