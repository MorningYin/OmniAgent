[Assistant]
1. The man in the grey jacket is on the right side of the image and appears as a medium-brightness silhouette. The man in the dark blue suit is on the left side, also a medium-brightness silhouette, but slightly darker than the man in grey, indicating he is farther away. 
2. Since the man in the dark blue suit is darker (farther) than the man in the grey jacket (closer), the man in the dark blue suit is further from the camera.
