[Round 1] Direct answer
============================================================

[User] <image> + answer prompt

[Assistant]
The projector is mounted on the ceiling near the front of the room, while the man in yellow is seated further back in the audience. Since the projector is closer to the camera's perspective (near the front), it is the closer object.

Answer: A

[User] <depth_map> + depth prompt

[Assistant]
1. The projector is visible as a small, bright white shape near the center-top of the depth map, indicating it is very close to the camera. The man in yellow is not clearly identifiable as a distinct, bright region in the depth map; he appears as a medium-gray silhouette among other people, indicating he is farther away than the projector.
2. Comparing the brightness, the projector is significantly brighter (closer) than the man in yellow (farther).
3. Based on the depth map, the projector is closer to the camera.
