[User] <depth_map> + depth prompt

[Assistant]
1. The dog is represented by a bright, white region in the lower-left of the depth map, indicating it is close to the camera. The suitcase is represented by a medium-gray region in the upper-center, which is darker than the dog’s region, indicating it is farther from the camera.  
2. Since the suitcase is darker (farther) than the dog (closer), the suitcase is further away from the camera.
