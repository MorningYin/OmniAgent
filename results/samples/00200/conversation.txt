[Round 1] Direct answer
============================================================

[User] <image> + answer prompt

[Assistant]
The yellow box sign on the right is more prominently displayed and appears larger in the frame compared to the yellow store sign on the left, indicating it is closer to the camera. The bus and van are also closer than the background buildings, but between the two signs, the one on the right is nearer.

Answer: B

[Round 2] Depth-assisted answer
============================================================

[User] <depth_map> + depth prompt

[Assistant]
1. The "yellow store sign on the left" is not visible in the depth map as it is not present in the grayscale image. The "yellow box sign on the right" also does not appear as a distinct object in the depth map; the right side shows a dark, low-brightness region corresponding to the building facade or background, not a sign.  
2. Since neither object is clearly identifiable in the depth map, we cannot compare their brightness to determine which is closer.  
3. Based on the provided depth map, the question cannot be answered with certainty. However, since the prompt requires a single letter answer and the previous answer was B, we must choose the most plausible option given the available data. The right side is darker than the left side, suggesting the right side is farther, which contradicts the previous answer. But since the signs themselves are not visible, we must rely on the previous conclusion that the right sign was closer based on the original image. 

Answer: B
