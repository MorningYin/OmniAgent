[Assistant]
1. The train occupies the right and central portion of the image, appearing as a large, bright white shape, indicating it is very close to the camera. The beverage vending machine is on the far left, visible as a darker, less bright shape, indicating it is farther away.  
2. Since the beverage vending machine is darker (farther) than the train (closer), it is the object further away from the camera.
