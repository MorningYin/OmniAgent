[User] <depth_map> + depth prompt

[Assistant]
1. The white digital billboard is located on the left side of the image, appearing as a dark, almost black region in the depth map, indicating it is far from the camera. The bicycle, located near the woman on the right, appears as a medium-brightness region, meaning it is closer than the billboard.
2. Since the billboard is darker (farther) than the bicycle (closer), the billboard is further away from the camera.
