The sandwich on the plate is in the foreground, and the refrigerator with drinks is in the background. The person in the white shirt is also in the background, behind the table. Therefore, the refrigerator with drinks is farther away from the camera than the sandwich, but since the sandwich is not an option, we compare the two given options. The refrigerator is clearly behind the person, who is also behind the table, so the refrigerator is farther than the person. However, the question asks which is closer to the camera. Since the person is standing behind the table and the refrigerator is further back, the person is closer than the refrigerator. But wait, the sandwich is not an option. Let me re-read. The options are A. person in white shirt and B. refrigerator with drinks. The person is standing behind the table, and the refrigerator is behind the person. So the person is closer to the camera than the refrigerator. 

Answer: A
