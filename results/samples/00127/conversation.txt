[Round 2] Depth-assisted answer
============================================================

[User] <depth_map> + depth prompt

[Assistant]
1. The green road sign is visible as a bright, whitish region in the depth map, indicating it is close to the camera. The white building is a darker, less bright region in the background, indicating it is farther away.
2. Since the white building is darker (farther) than the green road sign (closer), the white building is further from the camera.

Answer: B
