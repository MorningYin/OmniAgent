The white van is in the background on the left side of the image, while the pedestrian traffic light is in the upper center, further back. The cyclist and the red bus are in the mid-ground, but the pedestrian traffic light is positioned higher and further away than the van. However, the van is closer to the camera than the pedestrian traffic light, as it occupies more space in the frame and is positioned lower and closer to the foreground. The pedestrian traffic light is higher up and appears smaller, indicating it is farther away. Therefore, the white van is closer to the camera.
