[User] <depth_map> + depth prompt

[Assistant]
1. The umbrella is located in the background of the scene, appearing as a dark, medium-gray shape in the depth map, indicating it is far from the camera. The wall lamp, mounted on the building wall, is visible as a bright white region in the depth map, indicating it is very close to the camera. 
2. Comparing the brightness, the wall lamp is significantly brighter (closer) than the umbrella, which is darker (farther). 
3. Therefore, the wall lamp is closer to the camera.
