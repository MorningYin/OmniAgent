The cow is visible in the background, further away from the camera than both the cup (held by the person in the foreground) and the pole on the right, which is closer to the camera. However, since the cow is not one of the options, we must compare the two given options. The pole on the right is positioned near the edge of the frame and appears smaller in scale relative to the cup, indicating it is further away. The cup is held by the person, who is close to the camera.
