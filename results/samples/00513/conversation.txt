[User] <depth_map> + depth prompt

[Assistant]
1. The gasoline barrel is located on the far left, near the bottom edge of the image. In the depth map, its region is relatively dark, indicating it is farther from the camera. The potted plants are also on the far left, near the bottom-left corner, and their region is also dark, but slightly less dark than the gasoline barrel’s region, suggesting they are slightly closer to the camera than the barrel.

2. Comparing the brightness: the gasoline barrel is darker than the potted plants, meaning it is farther from the camera.
