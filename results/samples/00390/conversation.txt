[User] <depth_map> + depth prompt

[Assistant]
1. The person in the white sweater is represented by a medium-dark silhouette in the background, indicating they are farther from the camera. The stainless steel scale, located in front of the person, appears as a medium-brightness object, closer to the camera than the person.
2. Since the person is darker (farther) and the scale is brighter (closer), the person is further away from the camera.
