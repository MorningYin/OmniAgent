[User] <image> + answer prompt

[Assistant]
The bus sign is located further down the street, beyond the Carphone Warehouse storefront and pedestrians, while the forward sign is closer to the camera’s viewpoint near the traffic light. Therefore, the bus sign is further away.

Answer: B

[Round 2] Depth-assisted answer
============================================================

[User] <depth_map> + depth prompt

[Assistant]
1. The "forward sign" is located on the right side of the image, near the traffic light pole. In the depth map, its region is medium-dark, indicating it is farther than the traffic light but closer than the bus sign. The "bus sign" is located further to the right and appears as a darker (blacker) region in the depth map, indicating it is the farthest object from the camera.

2. Comparing the brightness: the bus sign is darker than the forward sign, meaning it is farther away.

Answer: B
