[Round 1] Direct answer
============================================================

[User] <image> + answer prompt

[Assistant]
The cat is positioned behind the dog and appears to be further back in the scene, while the dog is in the foreground, closer to the camera. Therefore, the cat is further away from the camera.

Answer: A

[Round 2] Depth-assisted answer
============================================================

[User] <depth_map> + depth prompt

[Assistant]
1. The cat is located in the upper portion of the image, and its region is medium-dark in the depth map. The dog is in the foreground, and its region is very bright (almost white) in the depth map.
2. Since brighter pixels indicate objects closer to the camera, the dog is closer, and the cat is further away.
