[Round 1] Direct answer
============================================================

[User] <image> + answer prompt

[Assistant]
The red car on the right is positioned closer to the camera, as it is on the same side of the street as the viewer and appears larger and more detailed compared to the red sports car on the left, which is further down the road. 

Answer: B

[Round 2] Depth-assisted answer
============================================================

[User] <depth_map> + depth prompt

[Assistant]
1. The red sports car on the left is not visible in the depth map as a distinct object; the area where it would be is dark, indicating it is far away. The red car on the right is also not clearly visible as a distinct object, but the area around it is medium to dark, indicating it is farther than the foreground elements. The most prominent bright object in the foreground is the trash can and the signpost, which are much closer to the camera.

2. Comparing the brightness: The foreground trash can and signpost are bright, while the areas corresponding to the cars are dark or medium-dark, indicating they are farther away. The red car on the right is not significantly brighter than the red sports car on the left in the depth map — both are far away.

3. Based on the depth map, neither car is close to the camera; the trash can and signpost are the closest objects. However, since the question asks to choose between the two cars, and both are far away, the red car on the right appears slightly less dark (medium) than the area for the red sports car on the left (dark), suggesting it is slightly closer.
