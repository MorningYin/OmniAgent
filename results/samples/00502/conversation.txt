The umbrella is positioned behind the man and table, while the trees are in the far background. The man and the objects on the table (like the beer bottle and glass) are in the foreground, but since the umbrella is still behind the man, the trees are farther away than the umbrella. However, the question asks which object is closer to the camera. The umbrella is closer to the camera than the trees, as it is in the mid-ground, while the trees are in the far background. The man and table are even closer, but among the given options, the umbrella is the closest.
