The motorcycle is positioned behind the parking meter in the scene, and the parking meter is closer to the foreground. Therefore, the motorcycle is further away from the camera.

Answer: B

[Round 2] Depth-assisted answer
============================================================

[User] <depth_map> + depth prompt

[Assistant]
1. The parking meter is represented by a bright white region in the center-right of the depth map, indicating it is close to the camera. The motorcycle, visible as a darker silhouette to the left, appears less bright than the parking meter, indicating it is farther away.
2. Comparing the two, the motorcycle is darker (and thus farther) than the parking meter (which is brighter and closer).

Answer: B
