[User] <image> + answer prompt

[Assistant]
The poles are positioned behind the fire hydrant in the image, indicating they are further away from the camera's perspective. The fire hydrant is in the foreground, while the poles are slightly further back in the scene.

Answer: B

[User] <depth_map> + depth prompt

[Assistant]
1. The fire hydrant is located in the center of the image and appears as a medium-brightness region in the depth map. The poles, one on each side of the fire hydrant, appear as darker regions compared to the fire hydrant.
2. Since darker regions are farther from the camera according to the depth map, the poles are farther away than the fire hydrant.
3. The previous answer was incorrect; this depth map confirms that the poles are further away.

Answer: B
