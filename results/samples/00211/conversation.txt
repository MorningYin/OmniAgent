[Round 1] Direct answer
============================================================

[User] <image> + answer prompt

[Assistant]
The puddle on the left is positioned further back in the scene, as it is partially obscured by the bicycle and appears smaller in perspective compared to the puddle on the right, which is closer to the foreground. Therefore, the puddle on the left is further away from the camera.

Answer: A

[Round 2] Depth-assisted answer
============================================================

[User] <depth_map> + depth prompt

[Assistant]
1. The puddle of water on the left is not visible in the depth map as a distinct object; the area where it would be (left side of the image) is mostly dark gray, indicating it is far from the camera. The puddle of water on the right is also not clearly visible as a separate object, but the area near the bicycle’s rear wheel (which is on the right side of the image) is brighter, suggesting it is closer to the camera. Since the left side is darker, the puddle on the left is further away.
2. Comparing the two, the left side is darker (farther) than the right side (closer), so the puddle on the left is further away.
