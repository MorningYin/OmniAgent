[Assistant]
1. The gloves are located on the motorcycle’s handlebars, which is the foreground object and appears as a bright (white) region in the depth map. The gray bag is carried by a person in the background, appearing as a darker (gray) region in the depth map.  
2. Since the gray bag is darker in the depth map, it is farther from the camera than the gloves.
