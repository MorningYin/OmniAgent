[User] <depth_map> + depth prompt

[Assistant]
1. The yellow traffic sign is a bright white diamond-shaped object in the center-right of the image, indicating it is relatively close to the camera. The traffic light is located on a utility pole further to the left and appears as a darker, less bright region compared to the sign. 2. Since the traffic light region is darker than the yellow traffic sign region in the depth map, it is farther from the camera. Answer: B
