The coffee cup is positioned behind the donuts and further back on the table, making it the object furthest from the camera's viewpoint. The donuts are being held closer to the foreground.

Answer: B

[Round 2] Depth-assisted answer
============================================================

[User] <depth_map> + depth prompt

[Assistant]
1. The donuts are in the foreground, held by hands, and appear as bright white regions in the depth map, indicating they are close to the camera. The coffee cup is visible in the background, behind the donuts, and appears as a darker, less bright region in the depth map, indicating it is farther from the camera.

2. Since the coffee cup is darker (farther) than the donuts (brighter, closer), the coffee cup is further away from the camera.

Answer: B
