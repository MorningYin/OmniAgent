1. The person is represented by a bright white silhouette in the lower-left portion of the image, indicating they are close to the camera. The street sign is also bright white, but it is positioned higher and further back in the image, appearing slightly less bright than the person. 2. Since the person is brighter (closer) than the street sign, the street sign must be further away from the camera. Answer: B
