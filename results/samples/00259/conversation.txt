[Round 1] Direct answer
============================================================

[User] <image> + answer prompt

[Assistant]
The wooden chair on the left is partially obscured by a black bag and is closer to the foreground than the chair next to the dining table, which is visible in the background behind the couch. Therefore, the chair next to the dining table is further away from the camera.

Answer: B

[User] <depth_map> + depth prompt

[Assistant]
1. The "wooden chair on the left" appears as a dark, shadowy shape in the background on the left side of the image, indicating it is far from the camera. The "chair next to the dining table" is also in the background, but it is slightly less dark and appears as a medium-dark shape, suggesting it is closer to the camera than the wooden chair on the left.

2. Since the wooden chair on the left is darker (and thus farther) than the chair next to the dining table in the depth map, the wooden chair on the left is further away from the camera.
